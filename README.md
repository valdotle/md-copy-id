Browser extension allowing to set a (customizable) shortcut to copy the ID of the hovered element on [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org/). 

To install on:
* Chromium: go to the extension manager and enable developer mode, then select "load unpacked" and load the Chrome folder
* Firefox: go to the extension manager, select "install add-on from file" and upload the .xpi file from the Firefox folder
* other browser: I haven't bothered with those, feel free to create a compatible version and make a PR for it though 

**The default shortcut is Alt+M.** To change it, navigate to extensions > (keyboard) shortcuts and change the shortcut for the "Copy hovered resource ID" command. Keep in mind that overwriting your browser's default shortcut may result in unexpected behavior (or the shortcut not working at all).
