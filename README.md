Browser extension allowing to set a (customizable) shortcut to copy the ID of the hovered element on [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org/). To install on:
* Chromium: go to the extension manager and enable developer mode, then select "load unpacked" and load the Chrome folder
* Firefox: go to the extension manager, select "install add-on from file" and upload the .xpi file from the Firefox folder
* other browser: I haven't bothered with those, feel free to create a compatible version and make a PR for it though
